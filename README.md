Website For Camp Sus: Web Site for Camping Trip Coordination

As a front-end engineer with expertise in Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, I created a custom web site for coordinating our camping trip. My goal was to design, develop, and deploy a user-friendly site with responsive design for seamless navigation across all devices.

To achieve this, I utilized my skills in front-end development to build a site that is both engaging and accessible to all users. I ensured the website was tested thoroughly to guarantee its functionality and responsiveness, regardless of the user's device or browser.

In addition, I incorporated modern design trends to create a visually appealing and engaging experience for the site's visitors. The website's design prioritizes usability, allowing users to easily navigate and access the information they need.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to manage a project from start to finish, demonstrating my skills in design, development, deployment, and testing. As a front-end engineer, I'm excited to continue honing my skills and taking on new challenges in the field.
